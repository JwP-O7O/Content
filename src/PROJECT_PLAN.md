# GEMINI Content Creator Project Plan

## Project Overview
This project is a sophisticated, autonomous AI agent system built with Python. Its primary purpose is to perform crypto-market analysis, generate content based on that analysis, and manage a social media community. The system is designed to be fully autonomous, with a multi-phase roadmap that includes core content creation, audience building, monetization, and self-learning optimization.

## Architecture
The architecture is modular, with a clear separation of concerns. It uses a series of specialized AI agents, each responsible for a specific task in the content pipeline. The agents are coordinated by an orchestrator.

## Roadmap

### Phase 1: Core Content Loop
- **Market Scanner:** Continuously scans crypto markets (Binance, News, Twitter).
- **Analysis:** Interprets data into insights.
- **Content Strategy:** Decides what to post.
- **Content Creation:** Writes tweets, threads, blogs.
- **Publishing:** Posts to platforms.

### Phase 2: Audience Building
- **Engagement:** Replies to comments, likes relevant posts.
- **Image Generation:** Creates visuals for posts.
- **Analytics:** Tracks engagement metrics.

### Phase 3: Monetization
- **Conversion:** Identifies high-value users for upsell.
- **Onboarding:** Welcomes new paying members.
- **Exclusive Content:** Creates high-alpha content for paid channels.
- **Community Moderation:** Keeps the community safe.

### Phase 4: Optimization (Self-Learning)
- **Strategy Tuning:** Adjusts parameters based on performance.
- **A/B Testing:** Tests different content styles.
- **Performance Analytics:** Deep dive into ROI.
- **Feedback Loop:** Orchestrates the self-improvement cycle.
